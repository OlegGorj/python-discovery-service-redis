##  Service discovery


This little piece of code uses the `redis-py` package https://docs.redis.com/latest/rs/references/client_references/client_python/ to interact with Azure Redis.

The `check_and_subscribe_channel()` function is defined to check if a Redis channel exists using the `exists()` method of the Redis client.
If the channel exists, it subscribes to the channel using the `subscribe()` method of the Redis client's pubsub object, and prints a message to the console.
The function then enters a loop that listens for messages published to the channel using the `listen()` method of the Redis client's pubsub object.
If a message is received, it prints the message to the console. 
If the channel doesn't exist, it prints a message to the console.

Note that this code assumes that the Azure Redis connection details are stored in environment variables `REDIS_HOST` and `REDIS_KEY`.
These can be set in a `.env` file or in the system environment variables.
