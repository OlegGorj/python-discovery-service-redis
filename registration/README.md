##  Registration component of service discovery


This little piece of code uses the Redis Cache Python client library to interact with Azure Redis.
The code uses `redis-py` package https://docs.redis.com/latest/rs/references/client_references/client_python/.
The Redis client object is created using the connection details, including the Redis host, access key, and SSL configuration.

This code uses the Azure Identity library to authenticate with Azure and obtain the credentials needed to interact with the Azure Redis service.
The Redis client object is created using the Azure Redis name and SSL configuration.

The `check_and_create_channel()` function is defined to check if a Redis channel exists using the `exists()` method of the Redis client. If the channel exists, it prints a message to the console.
Well, if the channel doesn't exist, it creates the channel using the `execute_command()` method of the Redis client with the `PUBLISH` command, and prints a message to the console.

The `register_service()` function is defined to publish the service details to the Redis channel using the `publish()` method of the Redis client.
The service details are stored in a dictionary object and converted to a string using the `str()` method.

Note that this code assumes that the Azure Redis details are stored in environment variables `SUBSCRIPTION_ID`, `RESOURCE_GROUP`, and `REDIS_NAME`.
These can be set in a .env file or in the system environment variables.

This code can be run on the server side of a microservice architecture to check if a Redis channel exists and create it if it doesn't, and then register the service for discovery using Azure Redis Pub/Sub.
This ensures that the Redis channel is available for publishers and subscribers to use, and that the service is discoverable by other services.

[TODO] compose TF code to deploy simple instance of Azure Redis

[TODO] add requirements file
